        Located on a vibrant pedestrianised market street, Caravan Exmouth Market is a bright
        <br>
        airy space with glazed frontage on two sides and an outside terrace on the market.
        <br>
        Serving our signature well-travelled breakfast and all day food and drinks menus,
        <br>
        along with our freshly roasted coffee from the Caravan roastery, our style is open,
        <br> relaxed and friendly. Come down for a coffee with the morning paper, a cocktail and
        <br>small plates in the evening and anything in between!
        <br>
